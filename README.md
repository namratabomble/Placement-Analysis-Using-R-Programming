# Placement-Analysis-Using-R-Programming
**Description:**</br>
For the Human Resource department,it is hard to analyse the candidates based on their degree mars, online test marks, mba marks,etc. We can easily analyse the dataset by using R studio by performing data mining algorithms and visualization.

**Data Description:**</br>
Link to Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement
Number of Rows: 215
Number of columns: 15
Number of Attributes: 7 numeric
Attribute Information:
1. sl no.
2. gender
3. SSC percentage
4. HSC percentage 
5. Degree percentage
6. Test percentage
7. MBA percentage
Missing Attribute Values: None
</br></br>
**Approach:**</br>
a.	Extracting data from a large Dataset:
<br> 1.Type the following to get the data from a csv file and store it in a Placement_Data variable.<br>
b.	Exploratory analysis
<br> 1.Returns the information of each column or attribute with data type.<br>
c.	Regression and Correlation
<br>1. Regression <br>
•	A linear regression is a statistical model that analyzes the relationship between a response variable (often called y) and one or more variables and their interactions (often called x or explanatory variables).<br>
<br>2. Correlation <br>
•	Correlation is a statistical measure that suggests the level of linear dependence between two variables, that occur in pair – just like what we have here in speed and dist. Correlation can take values between -1 to +1.<br>
<br> d.	Apply Data Mining algorithms(Classification, Clustering etc)<br>
Clustering of dataset using k-means clustering algorithm<br>
•	Defining a cluster in R based on existing customer data<br>
•	Using WSS function<br>
•	The WSS (Weighted sum statistics)helps us to determine optimum no of clustes. It plots a graph which shows a kink(sudden rise)at particular values denotes the optimum no of clusters to be defined.<br><br>
e.Classification of dataset using Naïve Bayes algorithm<br>
•	Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.<br>
•	Bayes’ Theorem finds the probability of an event occurring given the probability of another event that has already occurred.
